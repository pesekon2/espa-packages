# espa-packages

In 2020, [USGS-EROS](https://github.com/USGS-EROS/) closed its GitHub
repositories. However, some projects were using their repositories in
deployment for setup of Docker images, etc. The original links were not valid
anymore.

In the `Releases` section of this repository, you will find these packages in
their original, unchanged states with the original "un-license". This
repository is set up only to serve as an alternative source for these lost
packages.

Primarily packages and their versions I have personally needed for some
projects are provided here, but feel free to let me know about some others and
I can host them here too.
